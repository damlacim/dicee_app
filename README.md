# Dicee App

Hey folks! This is Dicee App. It doesn't have many features but sweet. I learned some things while doing this. 
I learned how to use a button yayy.

You will see two pictures of dice on the application screen.

Each time we touch the dice, the dice will change randomly. I used the random function here. I guess that's it. Go girl.
